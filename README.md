Micro Mouse â€“ Automated Maze Solver

Brief Overview:
- This project was an autonomous maze-solving bot developed for the "Shaastra" event held at IIT Madras. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, the bot could 
  navigate a complex maze to reach the goal while avoiding damage to the maze walls.

Key Features:
-	Fully automated maze solver using Dijkstra's algorithm.
-	Equipped with 3 ultrasonic sensors (front, left, right) for distance detection and pathfinding.
-	SD card module for storing maze data and path calculations.
-	Designed to handle complex mazes that simple line follower bots cannot solve.

Technologies Used:
- Hardware: Arduino UNO R3, L298N motor driver, ultrasonic sensors, SD card module, 12V battery.
- Software: Arduino IDE, implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

My Role:
- Built the complete circuit and hardware for the bot.
- Collaborated on writing the code, including algorithm implementation and sensor integration.

Challenges Solved:
- Developing and implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in a real maze environment.
- Managing maze input data and calculating the shortest path dynamically.
- Debugging issues with hardware and sensor calibration.

Outcome:
- The Micro Mouse bot successfully navigated the maze, solving it partially. While it encountered some bugs, the project provided valuable insights 
  into robotics, pathfinding algorithms, and hardware-software integration.
